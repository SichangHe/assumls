- [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs): module wiring and public exports for LSP and lint entrypoints.
- [src/model.rs](src/model.rs): core data structs for assumption docs, tag hits, and diagnostics.
- [src/parser.rs](src/parser.rs): parses ASSUM.md headings, scans @ASSUME:<name> tags, resolves scopes, and file ignores.
- [src/index.rs](src/index.rs): builds scoped index, sorts completions, computes diagnostics, and serves hover/completion/definition/references/rename via actor.
- [src/lsp.rs](src/lsp.rs): LSP server backend, manages overlays, publishes diagnostics (unused as hints), stdio runner; advertises hover Markdown, completion, definition, references, rename.
- [src/lint.rs](src/lint.rs): static lint entry that reuses the index diagnostics and prints CLI findings using workspace-relative paths when possible.
- [src/main.rs](src/main.rs): CLI mode switch (LSP vs lint) and tracing setup.
- [tests/check_cli.rs](tests/check_cli.rs): CLI snapshots covering valid multi-language nested workspace, failure with missing definitions and unused roots, and tool-missing PATH handling.
- [tests/lsp_e2e.rs](tests/lsp_e2e.rs): LSP hover/completion/rename snapshot over nested web/app.js, with path sanitization and deterministic ordering.
- [test_data/cli_valid](test_data/cli_valid): multi-language nested workspace (Rust, JS, TS, Python) with overlapping shared_name scopes and multi-paragraph definitions; all assumption references live in comments and expect no diagnostics.
- [test_data/cli_invalid](test_data/cli_invalid): nested workspace with missing assumptions across scopes plus unused root definition; references are in comments to avoid syntax errors while still producing warnings/errors.
- [test_data/lsp_ws](test_data/lsp_ws): LSP fixture mirroring multi-scope setup for hover/completion/rename coverage; assumption tags live in comments.
